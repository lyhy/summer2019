# Solid Design Princile
## Single Resonsibility Principle
- A class should only have one reason to change
## Open-Close Principle
- A class should be open for extension but close for modification
## Liskov Segrgation Principle
- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interface
## Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-level modules shoudl not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions


## Creational Patterns
- Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
## Structural Patterns
## Behavioral Patterns

# Builder
- Simple initializer
- Lots of ceremony to create
- too many arguments vs piecewise construction
- builder provides API for constructing an object step-by-step
