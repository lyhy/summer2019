 * The width of a sequence is the difference between the maximum and minimum
 * elements in the sequence.
 * 
 * Given an array of integers nums, return the sum of the widths of all the
 * non-empty subsequences of nums. Since the answer may be very large, return
 * it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting
 * some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 * For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,1,3]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2,1], [2,3], [1,3],
 * [2,1,3].
 * The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.
 * The sum of these widths is 6.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 *
