 *
 * Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest
 * square containing only 1's and return its area.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix =
 * [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [["0"]]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * m == matrix.length
 * n == matrix[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 300
 * matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
