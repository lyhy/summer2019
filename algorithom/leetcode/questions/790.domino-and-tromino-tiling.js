 *
 * You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You
 * may rotate these shapes.
 * 
 * Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since
 * the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are
 * different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the
 * board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a
 * tile.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The five different ways are show above.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 1000
 *
