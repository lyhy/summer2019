 *
 * An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three
 * elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the
 * same.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic
 * sequences.
 * 
 * 
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of
 * nums.
 * 
 * A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and
 * [1,2,3,4] itself.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
 * -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
 *
