 * Testcase Example:  '5'
 *
 * You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The
 * staircase consists of k rows where the i^th row has exactly i coins. The
 * last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
 * 
 * Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you
 * will build.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Because the 3^rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 8
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Because the 4^th row is incomplete, we return 3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
