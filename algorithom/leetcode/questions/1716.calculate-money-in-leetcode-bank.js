 *
 * Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode
 * bank every day.
 * 
 * He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday
 * to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent
 * Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday. 
 * 
 * Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank
 * at the end of the n^th day.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: After the 4^th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 10
 * Output: 37
 * Explanation: After the 10^th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) +
 * (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2^nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.

 * 
 * Input: n = 20
 * Output: 96
 * Explanation: After the 20^th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) +
 * (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.
