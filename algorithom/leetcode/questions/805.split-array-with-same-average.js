 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]'
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums.
 * 
 * You should move each element of nums into one of the two arrays A and B such
 * that A and B are non-empty, and average(A) == average(B).
 * 
 * Return true if it is possible to achieve that and false otherwise.
 * 
 * Note that for an array arr, average(arr) is the sum of all the elements of
 * arr over the length of arr.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both
 * of them have an average of 4.5.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,1]
 * Output: false
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 30
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
