 * Testcase Example:  '"ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"'
 *
 * You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts
 * as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.
 * 
 * Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
 * Output: [9,7,8]
 * Explanation:
 * The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
 * This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
 * A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it
 * splits s into less parts.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
 * Output: [10]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 500
 * s consists of lowercase English letters.
