 * Testcase Example:  '[" /","/ "]'
 *
 * An n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists
 * of a '/', '\', or blank space ' '. These characters divide the square into
 * contiguous regions.
 * 
 * Given the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of
 * regions.
 * 
 * Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a '\' is represented as
 * '\\'.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [" /","/ "]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [" /","  "]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = ["\\/","/\\"]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to
 * \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = ["/\\","\\/"]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to
 * \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = ["//","/ "]
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= n <= 30
 * grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.
