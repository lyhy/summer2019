 * Testcase Example:  '[1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]'
 *
 * You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element
 * appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.
 * 
 * Return the single element that appears only once.
 * 
 * Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
 * Output: 10
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 *
