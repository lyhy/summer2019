 *
 * You want to build n new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built
 * in a line and are labeled from 1 to n.
 * 
 * However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new
 * buildings:
 * 
 * 
 * The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
 * The height of the first building must be 0.
 * The height difference between any two adjacent buildings cannot exceed 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific
 * buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array restrictions
 * where restrictions[i] = [idi, maxHeighti] indicates that building idi must
 * have a height less than or equal to maxHeighti.
 * 
 * It is guaranteed that each building will appear at most once in
 * restrictions, and building 1 will not be in restrictions.
 * 
 * Return the maximum possible height of the tallest building.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[2,1],[4,1]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed
 * height for each building.
 * We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,1,2], and the tallest
 * building has a height of 2.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 6, restrictions = []
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed
 * height for each building.
 * We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,4,5], and the tallest
 * building has a height of 5.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 10, restrictions = [[5,3],[2,5],[7,4],[10,3]]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed
 * height for each building.
 * We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,3], and the
 * tallest building has a height of 5.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 10^9
 * 0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 10^5)
 * 2 <= idi <= n
 * idiÂ is unique.
 * 0 <= maxHeighti <= 10^9
 *
