 * Testcase Example:  '"aaabbb"'
 *
 * There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:
 * 
 * 
 * The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
 * At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending
 * at any place and will cover the original existing characters.
 * 
 * 
 * Given a string s, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to
 * print it.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "aaabbb"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "aba"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of
 * the string, which will cover the existing character 'a'.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 100
 * s consists of lowercase English letters.
