 * Testcase Example:  '2'
 *
 * You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a
 * destination at position target.
 * 
 * You can make some number of moves numMoves so that:
 * 
 * 
 * On each move, you can either go left or right.
 * During the i^th move (starting from i == 1 to i == numMoves), you take i
 * steps in the chosen direction.
 * 
 * 
 * Given the integer target, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e.,
 * the minimum numMoves) to reach the destination.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: target = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * On the 1^st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
 * On the 2^nd move, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).
 * On the 3^rd move, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: target = 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * On the 1^st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
 * On the 2^nd move, we step from 1 to 3 (2 steps).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
 * target != 0
