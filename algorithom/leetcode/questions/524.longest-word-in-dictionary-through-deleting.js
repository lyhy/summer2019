 * Testcase Example:  '"abpcplea"\n["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]'
 *
 * Given a string s and a string array dictionary, return the longest string in
 * the dictionary that can be formed by deleting some of the given string
 * characters. If there is more than one possible result, return the longest
 * word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible
 * result, return the empty string.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "abpcplea", dictionary = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]
 * Output: "apple"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "abpcplea", dictionary = ["a","b","c"]
 * Output: "a"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 1000
 * s and dictionary[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
