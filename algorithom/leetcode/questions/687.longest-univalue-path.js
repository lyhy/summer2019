 * Testcase Example:  '[5,4,5,1,1,5]'
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the longest path,
 * where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not
 * pass through the root.
 * 
 * The length of the path between two nodes is represented by the number of
 * edges between them.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [5,4,5,1,1,5]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,4,5,4,4,5]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
 * The depth of the tree will not exceed 1000.
 *
