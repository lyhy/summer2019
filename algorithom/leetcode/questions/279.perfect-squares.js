 * Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that
 * sum to n.
 * 
 * A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other
 * words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9,
 * and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 12
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 13
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 10^4
