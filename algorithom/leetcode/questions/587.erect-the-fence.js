 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]'
 *
 * You are given an array trees where trees[i] = [xi, yi] represents the
 * location of a tree in the garden.
 * 
 * You are asked to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope as
 * it is expensive. The garden is well fenced only if all the trees are
 * enclosed.
 * 
 * Return the coordinates of trees that are exactly located on the fence
 * perimeter.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]
 * Output: [[1,1],[2,0],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2]]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: points = [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]
 * Output: [[4,2],[2,2],[1,2]]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= points.length <= 3000
 * points[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= xi, yi <= 100
 * All the given points are unique.
