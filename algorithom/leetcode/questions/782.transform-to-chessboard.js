 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]'
 *
 * You are given an n x n binary grid board. In each move, you can swap any two
 * rows with each other, or any two columns with each other.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a chessboard
 * board. If the task is impossible, return -1.
 * 
 * A chessboard board is a board where no 0's and no 1's are 4-directionally
 * adjacent.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: One potential sequence of moves is shown.
 * The first move swaps the first and second column.
 * The second move swaps the second and third row.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: board = [[0,1],[1,0]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Also note that the board with 0 in the top left corner, is also
 * a valid chessboard.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: board = [[1,0],[1,0]]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: No matter what sequence of moves you make, you cannot end with
 * a valid chessboard.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == board.length
 * n == board[i].length
 * 2 <= n <= 30
 * board[i][j] is eitherÂ 0 or 1.
