 *
 * An ugly number is a positive integer that is divisible by a, b, or c.
 * 
 * Given four integers n, a, b, and c, return the n^th ugly number.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rd is 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4th is
 * 6.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5th is
 * 10.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1000000000, a = 2, b = 217983653, c = 336916467
 * Output: 1999999984
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n, a, b, c <= 10^9
 * 1 <= a * b * c <= 10^18
 * It is guaranteed that the result will be in range [1, 2 * 10^9].
