 * Testcase Example:  '3\n[[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]\n0\n2\n1'
 *
 * There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an
 * array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there
 * is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.
 * 
 * You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price
 * from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return
 * -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k
 * = 1
 * Output: 200
 * Explanation: The graph is shown.
 * The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as
 * marked red in the picture.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k
 * = 0
 * Output: 500
 * Explanation: The graph is shown.
 * The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as
 * marked blue in the picture.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
 * flights[i].length == 3
 * 0 <= fromi, toi < n
 * fromi != toi
 * 1 <= pricei <= 10^4
 * There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
 * 0 <= src, dst, k < n
 * src != dst
 *
