 * Testcase Example:  '[2,2,3,2]'
 *
 * Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except
 * for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.
 * 
 * You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only
 * constant extra space.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
 * Output: 99
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
 * -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 * Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element
 * which appears once.
