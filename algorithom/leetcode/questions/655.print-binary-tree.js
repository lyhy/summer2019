 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, construct a 0-indexed m x n string matrix
 * res that represents a formatted layout of the tree. The formatted layout
 * matrix should be constructed using the following rules:
 * 
 * 
 * The height of the tree is heightÂ and the number of rows m should be equal to
 * height + 1.
 * The number of columns n should be equal to 2^height+1 - 1.
 * Place the root node in the middle of the top row (more formally, at location
 * res[0][(n-1)/2]).
 * For each node that has been placed in the matrix at position res[r][c],
 * place its left child at res[r+1][c-2^height-r-1] and its right child at
 * res[r+1][c+2^height-r-1].
 * Continue this process until all the nodes in the tree have been placed.
 * Any empty cells should contain the empty string "".
 * 
 * 
 * Return the constructed matrix res.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2]
 * Output: 
 * [["","1",""],
 * ["2","",""]]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
 * Output: 
 * [["","","","1","","",""],
 * ["","2","","","","3",""],
 * ["","","4","","","",""]]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2^10].
 * -99 <= Node.val <= 99
 * The depth of the tree will be in the range [1, 10].
 *
