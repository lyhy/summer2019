 *
 * A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word
 * consists only of lowercase letters.
 * 
 * A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and
 * does not appear in the other sentence.
 * 
 * Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You
 * may return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
 * Output: ["sweet","sour"]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
 * Output: ["banana"]
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200
 * s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
 * s1 and s2 do not have leading or trailing spaces.
 * All the words in s1 and s2 are separated by a single space.
