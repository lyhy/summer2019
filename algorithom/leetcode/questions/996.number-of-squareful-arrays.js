 * Testcase Example:  '[1,17,8]'
 *
 * An array is squareful if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a
 * perfect square.
 * 
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of permutations of nums that
 * are squareful.
 * 
 * Two permutations perm1 and perm2 are different if there is some index i such
 * that perm1[i] != perm2[i].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,17,8]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,2,2]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 12
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
