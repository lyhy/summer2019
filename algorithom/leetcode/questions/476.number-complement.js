 *
 * The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the
 * 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010"
 * which is the integer 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Given an integer num, return its complement.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: num = 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
 * and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: num = 1
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and
 * its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= num < 2^31
 *
