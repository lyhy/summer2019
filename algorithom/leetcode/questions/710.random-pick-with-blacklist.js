 *
 * You are given an integer n and an array of unique integers blacklist. Design
 * an algorithm to pick a random integer in the range [0, n - 1] that is not in
 * blacklist. Any integer that is in the mentioned range and not in blacklist
 * should be equally likely to be returned.
 * 
 * Optimize your algorithm such that it minimizes the number of calls to the
 * built-in random function of your language.
 * 
 * Implement the Solution class:
 * 
 * 
 * Solution(int n, int[] blacklist) Initializes the object with the integer n
 * and the blacklisted integers blacklist.
 * int pick() Returns a random integer in the range [0, n - 1] and not in
 * blacklist.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input
 * ["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
 * [[7, [2, 3, 5]], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
 * Output
 * [null, 0, 4, 1, 6, 1, 0, 4]
 * 
 * Explanation
 * Solution solution = new Solution(7, [2, 3, 5]);
 * solution.pick(); // return 0, any integer from [0,1,4,6] should be ok. Note
 * that for every call of pick,
 * ‚Å†                // 0, 1, 4, and 6 must be equally likely to be returned
 * (i.e., with probability 1/4).
 * solution.pick(); // return 4
 * solution.pick(); // return 1
 * solution.pick(); // return 6
 * solution.pick(); // return 1
 * solution.pick(); // return 0
 * solution.pick(); // return 4
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 10^9
 * 0 <= blacklist.length <- min(10^5, n - 1)
 * 0 <= blacklist[i] < n
 * All the values of blacklist are unique.
 * At most 2 * 10^4 calls will be made to pick.
 *
