 *
 * For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k
 * times is a substring of sequence. The word's maximum k-repeating value is
 * the highest value k where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a
 * substring of sequence, word's maximum k-repeating value is 0.
 * 
 * Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of
 * word in sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: "abab" is a substring in "ababc".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ba"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: "ba" is a substring in "ababc". "baba" is not a substring in
 * "ababc".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ac"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: "ac" is not a substring in "ababc". 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= sequence.length <= 100
 * 1 <= word.length <= 100
 * sequence and wordÂ contains only lowercase English letters.
