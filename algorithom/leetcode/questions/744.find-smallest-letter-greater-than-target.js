 *
 * Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and
 * a character target, return the smallest character in the array that is
 * larger than target.
 * 
 * Note that the letters wrap around.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, if target == 'z' and letters == ['a', 'b'], the answer is
 * 'a'.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
 * Output: "c"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
 * Output: "f"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
 * Output: "f"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "g"
 * Output: "j"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "j"
 * Output: "c"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= letters.length <= 10^4
 * letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
 * letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 * letters contains at least two different characters.
 * target is a lowercase English letter.
