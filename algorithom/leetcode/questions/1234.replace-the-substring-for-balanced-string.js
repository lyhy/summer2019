 * Testcase Example:  '"QWER"'
 *
 * You are given a string containing only 4 kinds of characters 'Q', 'W', 'E'
 * and 'R'.
 * 
 * A string is said to be balanced if each of its characters appears n/4 times
 * where n is the length of the string.
 * 
 * Return the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any
 * other string of the same length to make the original string s balanced.
 * 
 * Return 0 if the string is already balanced.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "QWER"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: s is already balanced.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "QQWE"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that "RQWE" (or "QRWE") is
 * balanced.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "QQQW"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER". 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "QQQQ"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can replace the last 3 'Q' to make s = "QWER".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s.length is a multiple of 4
 * s contains only 'Q', 'W', 'E' and 'R'.
