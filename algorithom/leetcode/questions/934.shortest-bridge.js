 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,1],[1,0]]'
 *
 * You are given an n x n binary matrix grid where 1 represents land and 0
 * represents water.
 * 
 * An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1's not connected to any
 * other 1's. There are exactly two islands in grid.
 * 
 * You may change 0's to 1's to connect the two islands to form one island.
 * 
 * Return the smallest number of 0's you must flip to connect the two
 * islands.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == grid.length == grid[i].length
 * 2 <= n <= 100
 * grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
 * There are exactly two islands in grid.
