 *
 * Given two strings str1 and str2, return the shortest string that has both
 * str1 and str2 as subsequences. If there are multiple valid strings, return
 * any of them.
 * 
 * A string s is a subsequence of string t if deleting some number of
 * characters from t (possibly 0) results in the string s.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
 * Output: "cabac"
 * Explanation: 
 * str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first
 * "c".
 * str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last
 * "ac".
 * The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these
 * properties.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: str1 = "aaaaaaaa", str2 = "aaaaaaaa"
 * Output: "aaaaaaaa"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000
 * str1 and str2 consist of lowercase English letters.
