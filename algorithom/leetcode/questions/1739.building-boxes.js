 *
 * You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room
 * are all equal to n units. You are asked to place n boxes in this room where
 * each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to
 * placing the boxes:
 * 
 * 
 * You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
 * If box x is placed on top of the box y, then each side of the four vertical
 * sides of the box y must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.
 * 
 * 
 * Given an integer n, return the minimum possible number of boxes touching the
 * floor.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the three boxes.
 * These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the
 * left side.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the four boxes.
 * These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the
 * left side.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 10
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the ten boxes.
 * These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the
 * back side.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 10^9
