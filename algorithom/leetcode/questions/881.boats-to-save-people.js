 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2]\n3'
 *
 * You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the i^th
 * person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum
 * weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time,
 * provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * 1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 10^4
