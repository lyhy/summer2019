 * Testcase Example:  '"NES"'
 *
 * Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing
 * moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the
 * origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.
 * 
 * Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time
 * you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false
 * otherwise.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: path = "NES"
 * Output: false 
 * Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: path = "NESWW"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= path.length <= 10^4
 * path[i] is either 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'.
