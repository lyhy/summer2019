 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all
 * root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals
 * targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not
 * node references.
 * 
 * A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf
 * node. A leaf is a node with no children.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
 * Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]
 * Explanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
 * 5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
 * 5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
 * Output: []
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0
 * Output: []
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
 * -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000
