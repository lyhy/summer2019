 *
 * Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into
 * groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and consists of groupSize
 * consecutive cards.
 * 
 * Given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the i^th
 * card and an integer groupSize, return true if she can rearrange the cards,
 * or false otherwise.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= hand.length <= 10^4
 * 0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9
 * 1 <= groupSize <= hand.length
 * 
 *
