 * Testcase Example:  '[1,1,4,2,3]\n5'
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums and an integer x. In one operation, you
 * can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array nums
 * and subtract its value from x. Note that this modifies the array for future
 * operations.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of operations to reduce x to exactly 0 if it is
 * possible, otherwise, return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last two elements to
 * reduce x to zero.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [5,6,7,8,9], x = 4
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,2,20,1,1,3], x = 10
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last three elements and
 * the first two elements (5 operations in total) to reduce x to zero.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * 1 <= x <= 10^9
