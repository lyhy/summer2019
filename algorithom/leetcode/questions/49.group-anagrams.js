 *
 * Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return
 * the answer in any order.
 * 
 * An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a
 * different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly
 * once.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
 * Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: strs = [""]
 * Output: [[""]]
 * Example 3:
 * Input: strs = ["a"]
 * Output: [["a"]]
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= strs.length <= 10^4
 * 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
 * strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
