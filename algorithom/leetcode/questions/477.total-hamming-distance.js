 *
 * The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at
 * which the corresponding bits are different.
 * 
 * Given an integer array nums, return the sum of Hamming distances between all
 * the pairs of the integers in nums.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4,14,2]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is
 * 0010 (just
 * showing the four bits relevant in this case).
 * The answer will be:
 * HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2
 * + 2 + 2 = 6.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4,14,4]
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 * The answer for the given input will fit in a 32-bit integer.
