 * Testcase Example:  '"abcde"\n["a","bb","acd","ace"]'
 *
 * Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of
 * words[i] that is a subsequence of s.
 * 
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string
 * with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative
 * order of the remaining characters.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s:
 * "a", "acd", "ace".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * 1 <= words.length <= 5000
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 50
 * s and words[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
