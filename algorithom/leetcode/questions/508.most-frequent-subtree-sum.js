 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the most frequent subtree sum. If
 * there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any
 * order.
 * 
 * The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values
 * formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [5,2,-3]
 * Output: [2,-3,4]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [5,2,-5]
 * Output: [2]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
 * -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
 *
