 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,2,4]'
 *
 * You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from
 * 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got
 * duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one
 * number and loss of another number.
 * 
 * You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set
 * after the error.
 * 
 * Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return
 * them in the form of an array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
 * Output: [2,3]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [1,1]
 * Output: [1,2]
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 *
