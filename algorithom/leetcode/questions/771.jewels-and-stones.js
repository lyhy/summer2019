 * Testcase Example:  '"aA"\n"aAAbbbb"'
 *
 * You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are
 * jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in
 * stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones
 * you have are also jewels.
 * 
 * Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone
 * from "A".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Example 2:
 * Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
 * jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
 * All the characters of jewels are unique.
