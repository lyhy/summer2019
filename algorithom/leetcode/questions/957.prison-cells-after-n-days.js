 *
 * There are 8 prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or
 * vacant.
 * 
 * Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the
 * following rules:
 * 
 * 
 * If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant,
 * then the cell becomes occupied.
 * Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
 * 
 * 
 * Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the
 * row can't have two adjacent neighbors.
 * 
 * You are given an integer array cells where cells[i] == 1 if the i^th cell is
 * occupied and cells[i] == 0 if the i^th cell is vacant, and you are given an
 * integer n.
 * 
 * Return the state of the prison after n days (i.e., n such changes described
 * above).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], n = 7
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
 * Explanation: The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each
 * day:
 * Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
 * Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 * Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
 * Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], n = 1000000000
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * cells.length == 8
 * cells[i]Â is either 0 or 1.
 * 1 <= n <= 10^9
