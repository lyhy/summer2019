 *
 * Given two integers n and k, construct a list answer that contains n
 * different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following
 * requirement:
 * 
 * 
 * Suppose this list is answer =Â [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 -
 * a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct
 * integers.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the list answer. If there multiple valid answers, return any of
 * them.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, k = 1
 * Output: [1,2,3]
 * Explanation: The [1,2,3] has three different positive integers ranging from
 * 1 to 3, and the [1,1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, k = 2
 * Output: [1,3,2]
 * Explanation: The [1,3,2] has three different positive integers ranging from
 * 1 to 3, and the [2,1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= k < n <= 10^4
