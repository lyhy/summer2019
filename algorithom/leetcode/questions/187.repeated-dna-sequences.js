 *
 * The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A',
 * 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the
 * DNA.
 * 
 * Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the
 * 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA
 * molecule. You may return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
 * Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
 * Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.
