 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]]\n8'
 *
 * Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in
 * ascending order, return the k^th smallest element in the matrix.
 * 
 * Note that it is the k^th smallest element in the sorted order, not the k^th
 * distinct element.
 * 
 * You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n^2).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
 * Output: 13
 * Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and
 * the 8^th smallest number is 13
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
 * Output: -5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
 * 1 <= n <= 300
 * -10^9 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^9
 * All the rows and columns of matrix are guaranteed to be sorted in
 * non-decreasing order.
 * 1 <= k <= n^2
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * 
 * Could you solve the problem with a constant memory (i.e., O(1) memory
 * complexity)?
 * Could you solve the problem in O(n) time complexity? The solution may be too
 * advanced for an interview but you may find reading this paper fun.
