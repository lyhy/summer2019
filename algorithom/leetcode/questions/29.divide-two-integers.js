 *
 * Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using
 * multiplication, division, and mod operator.
 * 
 * The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its
 * fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335
 * would be truncated to -2.
 * 
 * Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
 * 
 * Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store
 * integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31, 2^31 − 1]. For this
 * problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 2^31 - 1, then return 2^31
 * - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -2^31, then return -2^31.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
 * Output: -2
 * Explanation: 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: dividend = 0, divisor = 1
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: dividend = 1, divisor = 1
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * -2^31 <= dividend, divisor <= 2^31 - 1
 * divisor != 0
