 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4]'
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of
 * parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way,
 * and return it.
 * 
 * Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one
 * mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
 * Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to
 * omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be
 * "1(2(4))(3)"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
 * Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
 * Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we cannot omit the
 * first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between
 * the input and the output.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
 *
