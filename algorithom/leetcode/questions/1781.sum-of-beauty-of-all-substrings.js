 *
 * The beauty of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most
 * frequent and least frequent characters.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, the beauty of "abaacc" is 3 - 1 = 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Given a string s, return the sum of beauty of all of its substrings.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "aabcb"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are
 * ["aab","aabc","aabcb","abcb","bcb"], each with beauty equal to 1.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "aabcbaa"
 * Output: 17
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <=^ 500
 * s consists of only lowercase English letters.
