 * Testcase Example:  '["alex","loves","leetcode"]'
 *
 * Given an array of strings words, return the smallest string that contains
 * each string in words as a substring. If there are multiple valid strings of
 * the smallest length, return any of them.
 * 
 * You may assume that no string in words is a substring of another string in
 * words.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
 * Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
 * Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be
 * accepted.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
 * Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= words.length <= 12
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
 * words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
 * All the strings of words are unique.
