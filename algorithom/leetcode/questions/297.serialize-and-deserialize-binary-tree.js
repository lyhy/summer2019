 *
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
 * sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
 * transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in
 * the same or another computer environment.
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
 * restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
 * You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
 * this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 * 
 * Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode
 * serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format,
 * so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
 * Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: []
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1]
 * Output: [1]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2]
 * Output: [1,2]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
