 *
 * Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could
 * become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.
 * 
 * We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for
 * every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4,2,3]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing
 * array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4,2,1]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one
 * element.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10^4
 * -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 *
