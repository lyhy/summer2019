 * suffix (excluding itself).

 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "level"
 * Output: "l"
 * Explanation: s contains 4 prefix excluding itself ("l", "le", "lev",
 * "leve"), and suffix ("l", "el", "vel", "evel"). The largest prefix which is
 * also suffix is given by "l".

 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "a"

 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s contains only lowercase English letters.
