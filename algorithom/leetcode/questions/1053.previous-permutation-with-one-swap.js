 *
 * Given an array of positive integers arr (not necessarily distinct), return
 * the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than arr, that can
 * be made with exactly one swap (A swap exchanges the positions of two numbers
 * arr[i] and arr[j]). If it cannot be done, then return the same array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [3,2,1]
 * Output: [3,1,2]
 * Explanation: Swapping 2 and 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [1,1,5]
 * Output: [1,1,5]
 * Explanation: This is already the smallest permutation.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [1,9,4,6,7]
 * Output: [1,7,4,6,9]
 * Explanation: Swapping 9 and 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [3,1,1,3]
 * Output: [1,3,1,3]
 * Explanation: Swapping 1 and 3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
 * 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
