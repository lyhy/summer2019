Problem: Subtree Removal (USACO 2020 US Open, Platinum)

Problem Statement:

You are given a tree with N nodes (1 <= N <= 10^5). Each node i has a value A[i] ( -10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9 ). You want to find the maximum sum of node values you can obtain by removing some subtrees from the tree. You must keep the root (node 1).

Input Format:

Line 1: N
Line 2: A[1] A[2] ... A[N]
Lines 3...N: u v (meaning node u and node v are connected by an edge)
Example Input:

5
-1 2 3 -2 4
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5

Graph
1 (-1)
    /  \
   2 (2)  3 (3)
  /  \
 4 (-2) 5 (4)

 Maximum sum: 8

 Okay, let's trace the execution of the algorithm on the example input:

5
-1 2 3 -2 4
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
1. Tree Structure:

The tree looks like this:

     1 (-1)
    /  \
   2 (2)  3 (3)
  /  \
 4 (-2) 5 (4)
2. DFS Traversal (and DP Calculation):

We start dfs(1, 0).

dfs(1, 0):

parent[1] = 0

adj[1] = {2, 3}

dp[1] = -1 (Initialized with the value of node 1)

dfs(2, 1):

parent[2] = 1

adj[2] = {1, 4, 5}

dp[2] = 2 (Initialized with the value of node 2)

dfs(4, 2):

parent[4] = 2
adj[4] = {2}
dp[4] = -2 (Initialized with the value of node 4)
No children (besides parent), so the loop doesn't execute.
dfs(4, 2) returns.
dfs(5, 2):

parent[5] = 2
adj[5] = {2}
dp[5] = 4 (Initialized with the value of node 5)
No children (besides parent), so the loop doesn't execute.
dfs(5, 2) returns.
Back in dfs(2, 1):

Loop through children of 2: 4 and 5 (excluding 1)
Child 4: dp[4] = -2 <= 0. So, we don't add dp[4] to dp[2].
Child 5: dp[5] = 4 > 0. So, dp[2] += 4, which makes dp[2] = 6.
dfs(2, 1) returns.

dfs(3, 1):

parent[3] = 1
adj[3] = {1}
dp[3] = 3 (Initialized with the value of node 3)
No children (besides parent), so the loop doesn't execute.
dfs(3, 1) returns.
Back in dfs(1, 0):

Loop through children of 1: 2 and 3.
Child 2: dp[2] = 6 > 0. So, dp[1] += 6, which makes dp[1] = 5. (-1+6=5)
Child 3: dp[3] = 3 > 0. So, dp[1] += 3, which makes dp[1] = 8. (5+3=8)
dfs(1, 0) returns.

3. Final Result:

dp[1] = 8.

Reconciliation - where did 7 come from?

Okay, the previous trace has a mistake! Let's go step-by-step, and be extra careful to calculate dp[1] correctly.

Starting from the tree shown above:

dfs(4,2): dp[4] = -2
dfs(5,2): dp[5] = 4
dfs(2,1): dp[2] = 2 + (dp[4]>0 ? dp[4] : 0) + (dp[5]>0 ? dp[5] : 0) = 2 + 0 + 4 = 6
dfs(3,1): dp[3] = 3
dfs(1,0): dp[1] = -1 + (dp[2]>0 ? dp[2] : 0) + (dp[3]>0 ? dp[3] : 0) = -1 + 6 + 3 = 8
So, the result shown here is dp[1] = 8.

Here's how we get 7 instead of 8, indicating an incorrect "keep" decision:

We keep node 1 (-1). We keep node 2 (2). We keep node 3 (3). We keep node 5 (4). We remove node 4 (-2). Total = -1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 8.

The correct way is:

Keep node 1 ( -1) Keep node 2 (2) Keep node 3 (3) Keep node 5 (4)

Which means keep the subtree rooted at 2 and 3. dp[1] = -1 + 6 + 3 = 8.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 100005;
long long A[MAXN];
vector<int> adj[MAXN];
long long dp[MAXN];
int parent[MAXN];

void dfs(int u, int p) {
    parent[u] = p;
    for (int v : adj[u]) {
        if (v != p) {
            dfs(v, u);
        }
    }

    dp[u] = A[u]; // Initialize with the node's own value

    for (int v : adj[u]) {
        if (v != p) {
            if (dp[v] > 0) {
                dp[u] += dp[v];
            }
        }
    }

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        cin >> A[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }

    dfs(1, 0); // Start DFS at the root (node 1), parent of root is 0

    cout << dp[1] << endl;

    return 0;
}

Test Case 1: Simple Line

Input:
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6

Output:
21
Explanation: All nodes have positive values, so we keep all of them.

Test Case 2: Alternating Signs

Input:
7
1 -2 3 -4 5 -6 7
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7

Output:
12
Explanation: 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 = 4. We should get: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. However this cannot occur since we must keep node 1, so all of the nodes will always be attached up to that point.

Test Case 3: Negative Root, Mixed Subtrees

Input:
5
-5 10 2 -3 4
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5

Output:
8
Explanation: Keep 1, 2, 5. Remove 3 and 4. (-5 + 10 + 4 = 9) We are unable to remove nodes 2 and 5, so we have to keep node 4 if we keep node 2. If we don't keep node 2, dp[1] = -5 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 4. dp[1] = -5 + 3 = -2.

Test Case 4: Large Negative Values

Input:
4
-1000 -2000 -3000 -4000
